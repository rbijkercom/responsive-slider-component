# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a responsive slider component that displays multiple slides in a horizontal scrollable container. The slider will use CSS scroll-snap for smooth navigation and display exactly 3 slides at a time, with flexible width sizing that adapts to the container rather than using fixed pixel values. The component will be purely CSS-based without JavaScript functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want a responsive slider component that displays 3 slides at once, so that I can showcase multiple content items in a compact, visually appealing layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the slider is rendered THEN the system SHALL display exactly 3 slides visible at any given time
2. WHEN the container width changes THEN the slides SHALL automatically adjust their width proportionally
3. WHEN there are at least 3 slides THEN the slider SHALL function properly with the minimum required content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth scrolling navigation between slides, so that I can easily browse through the content without jarring transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls horizontally THEN the system SHALL use CSS scroll-snap to snap to slide boundaries
2. WHEN scroll-snap is active THEN each slide SHALL align properly within the visible area
3. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and natural

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want flexible slide widths that don't use fixed pixel values, so that the slider can adapt to different screen sizes and container widths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the slider is implemented THEN slide widths SHALL be defined using relative units (percentages, viewport units, or flexbox)
2. WHEN the parent container resizes THEN the slides SHALL maintain their proportional sizing
3. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the slider SHALL remain responsive and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want a slider that works without JavaScript, so that I can have a lightweight, dependency-free component that works even when JavaScript is disabled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the slider is implemented THEN it SHALL function entirely through CSS without requiring JavaScript
2. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the slider SHALL still be fully functional
3. WHEN the component is loaded THEN it SHALL not depend on any JavaScript libraries or custom scripts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the ability to add various numbers of slides (minimum 3), so that I can accommodate different amounts of content while maintaining the slider's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN slides are added to the slider THEN the system SHALL support any number of slides equal to or greater than 3
2. WHEN there are more than 3 slides THEN users SHALL be able to scroll to access all slides
3. WHEN there are exactly 3 slides THEN the slider SHALL display all slides without scrolling capability

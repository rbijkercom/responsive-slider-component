# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a configurable responsive slider component system that can transform any list of items into an accessible slider with configurable slide counts. The system supports multiple slider instances on a single page, each with their own configuration via data attributes. The slider uses CSS scroll-snap for smooth navigation and allows configuration of slides per view for different screen sizes. The component includes optional JavaScript enhancement for drag interactions while maintaining CSS-only core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want a configurable slider component that can display different numbers of slides per view based on screen size, so that I can create responsive layouts that work optimally on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a slider element has rb-slides-per-view attribute THEN the system SHALL display that number of slides visible at desktop resolution
2. WHEN a slider element has rb-slides-per-view-tablet attribute THEN the system SHALL display that number of slides on tablet screens
3. WHEN a slider element has rb-slides-per-view-mobile attribute THEN the system SHALL display that number of slides on mobile screens
4. WHEN the container width changes between breakpoints THEN the slides SHALL automatically adjust their count and width proportionally
5. WHEN no responsive attributes are provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults (4 desktop, 3 tablet, 1 mobile)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to create multiple slider instances from different data sources on the same page, so that I can display various types of content (products, gallery items, etc.) in separate sliders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN list elements have rb-slider-element="list" and rb-slider-instance attributes THEN the system SHALL identify them as data sources
2. WHEN slider elements have rb-slider-element="slider" and rb-slider-instance attributes THEN the system SHALL generate sliders from matching list instances
3. WHEN multiple list instances are specified (semicolon-separated) THEN the system SHALL combine items from all specified instances
4. WHEN multiple sliders exist on the same page THEN each SHALL operate independently with their own configuration
5. WHEN a list instance is referenced by multiple sliders THEN the system SHALL handle this without conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want configurable gap spacing between slides, so that I can control the visual spacing to match my design requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a slider element has data-gap attribute THEN the system SHALL apply that spacing between slides
2. WHEN gap values use CSS units (rem, px, %) THEN the system SHALL respect those units
3. WHEN no gap is specified THEN the system SHALL use a default gap value
4. WHEN gap changes responsively THEN the slide calculations SHALL adjust accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth scrolling navigation between slides with proper snap behavior, so that I can easily browse through the content without jarring transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls horizontally THEN the system SHALL use CSS scroll-snap to snap to slide boundaries
2. WHEN scroll-snap is active THEN each slide SHALL align properly within the visible area
3. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and natural
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN the scrolling SHALL feel responsive and natural

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the slider to work without JavaScript as a core requirement, with optional JavaScript enhancement for drag interactions, so that I have a lightweight, dependency-free component with progressive enhancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the slider is implemented THEN the core functionality SHALL work entirely through CSS without requiring JavaScript
2. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the slider SHALL still be fully functional for scrolling and navigation
3. WHEN JavaScript is available THEN the system MAY enhance the experience with drag interactions
4. WHEN the component is loaded THEN it SHALL not depend on any external JavaScript libraries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want automatic slider generation from existing list markup, so that I can easily convert any list structure into a slider without manually restructuring my HTML.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL automatically detect list elements with appropriate data attributes
2. WHEN a list is detected THEN the system SHALL extract items and generate slider markup in the target container
3. WHEN list items contain complex HTML THEN the system SHALL preserve the original structure and styling
4. WHEN the original list is processed THEN it SHALL remain accessible for fallback scenarios

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the slider to be fully accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation, so that all users can interact with the content regardless of their abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the slider is generated THEN it SHALL include proper ARIA labels and roles
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN users SHALL be able to navigate through slides using arrow keys or tab
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the slider SHALL announce slide position and total count
4. WHEN slides contain interactive elements THEN focus management SHALL work properly

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds navigation control functionality to the existing responsive slider component. Users will be able to add previous/next navigation buttons within slider containers that automatically connect to and control the slider's scroll position. The navigation controls will use the existing data attribute system (`rb-slider-element="previous"` and `rb-slider-element="next"`) to identify and bind to their parent slider container. If no custom navigation elements are provided, the system will automatically create default navigation buttons unless explicitly disabled.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add navigation buttons inside a slider container, so that users can navigate through slides using clickable controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer adds an element with `rb-slider-element="previous"` inside a slider container THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and bind it as a previous navigation control
2. WHEN a developer adds an element with `rb-slider-element="next"` inside a slider container THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and bind it as a next navigation control
3. WHEN no custom navigation elements are present AND `rb-slider-navigation` is not set to "false" THEN the system SHALL automatically create default previous and next navigation buttons
4. WHEN a slider has `rb-slider-navigation="false"` attribute THEN the system SHALL not create or bind any navigation controls
5. WHEN navigation controls are detected or created THEN the system SHALL register click event handlers for slide navigation
6. WHEN multiple navigation controls exist in the same slider THEN the system SHALL bind all controls to the same slider instance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click previous/next buttons to navigate through slides, so that I can control slide navigation without using keyboard or drag interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a previous navigation control THEN the slider SHALL scroll backward by the number of slides currently visible
2. WHEN a user clicks a next navigation control THEN the slider SHALL scroll forward by the number of slides currently visible
3. WHEN the slider is at the beginning AND a user clicks previous THEN the slider SHALL remain at the beginning position
4. WHEN the slider is at the end AND a user clicks next THEN the slider SHALL remain at the end position
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the slider SHALL use smooth scrolling animation consistent with existing drag behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want navigation controls to be properly accessible, so that I can navigate slides using keyboard and screen readers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation controls are initialized THEN the system SHALL add appropriate ARIA labels describing their function
2. WHEN navigation controls are initialized THEN the system SHALL ensure they are keyboard focusable
3. WHEN a navigation control is disabled (at beginning/end) THEN the system SHALL update ARIA attributes to reflect the disabled state
4. WHEN a navigation control is activated THEN the system SHALL announce the navigation action to screen readers
5. WHEN navigation controls exist THEN the system SHALL update slider instructions to mention button navigation options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want navigation controls to work responsively, so that they adapt to different screen sizes and slide configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN navigation controls SHALL calculate scroll distances based on current slides-per-view configuration
2. WHEN slides-per-view changes due to responsive breakpoints THEN navigation SHALL scroll by the new number of visible slides
3. WHEN navigation controls are used on mobile devices THEN they SHALL work with touch interactions
4. WHEN navigation controls are styled THEN they SHALL not interfere with existing slider responsive behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want navigation controls to integrate seamlessly with existing slider functionality, so that all slider features continue to work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation controls are added THEN existing drag functionality SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN navigation controls are added THEN existing keyboard navigation SHALL continue to work unchanged
3. WHEN navigation controls are used THEN scroll-snap behavior SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN navigation controls trigger scrolling THEN the scroll position SHALL align with slide boundaries using existing snap logic
5. WHEN navigation controls are initialized THEN they SHALL not conflict with existing slider initialization or configuration

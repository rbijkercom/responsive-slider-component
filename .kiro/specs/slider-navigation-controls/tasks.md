# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement core navigation functionality in ResponsiveSlider class

  - Add `setupNavigationControls()` method to detect elements with `rb-slider-element="previous"` and `rb-slider-element="next"` within slider containers
  - Implement automatic creation of default navigation buttons when no custom navigation exists and `rb-slider-navigation` is not "false"
  - Add click event handlers for previous/next navigation with scroll distance calculation based on current slides-per-view
  - Add boundary detection to disable navigation at slider limits and smooth scrolling animation using existing scroll-snap behavior
  - Integrate navigation setup into existing `createSlider()` method after slider content generation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 2. Add accessibility and responsive features for navigation controls

  - Implement automatic ARIA label generation for navigation controls with dynamic state updates
  - Add keyboard support and focus management for navigation buttons
  - Update existing slider instructions to mention navigation button options
  - Ensure navigation scroll distances adapt to responsive breakpoint changes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Create demo implementation with styling
  - Add navigation buttons to existing slider in index.html with `rb-slider-element="previous"` and `rb-slider-element="next"` attributes
  - Create CSS styles for navigation controls in slider-style.css with hover, focus, and disabled states
  - Test both custom navigation elements and automatic default navigation creation
  - Ensure navigation controls integrate seamlessly with existing responsive layout and don't interfere with drag functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_
